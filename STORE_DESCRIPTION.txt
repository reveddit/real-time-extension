Reveddit real-time tracks the content you post and notifies you when something is removed, locked, reapproved or unlocked. Upon installing the extension, it will automatically subscribe to your username. To subscribe to additional usernames, create a separate browser profile, log into reddit as another username, and install the extension there.

To monitor additional comments or posts, click the subscribe button beneath the item, or right-click on a link and choose `reveddit subscribe`. Note that subscribing to a post does not subscribe to its comments, only the post itself.

Reveddit real-time is developed independently and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit. Enhancements will be added as they are developed. You can support this work through a non-tax-deductible donation:

Note, the extension is not able to track content from private subreddits.
